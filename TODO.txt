1. Better error catching and handling
2. Domain specific service definitions
X. Create the resolv.conf file in kickstart
4. Knife client regeneration from midwife so admin pem can stay put
X. Read file for keys instead of having them inline in the configuration
6. Volume group support
7. Possible raid support
8. Alot of the dsl build objects have a lot of the same types of methods... Can we tease out the delgators and the set methods into Core or some other object (possibly emit as well).
9. Figure out how to test kickstart file and bootstrap scripts.

scheme "default" do
  clearpart
  zerombr
  part "/boot" do
    size 100
    type "ext4"
    primary
  end

  part "swap" do
    size 0 # zero defaults to recommended
    type "swap"
    primary
  end

  part "pv.01" do
    size 1
    type "pv"
    grow
  end

  volgroup "sysvg" do
    physvol "pv.01"
    logvol "/" do
      name "lvroot"
      size 2000
    end
  end
end

Need to figure out where options are going???  I need them to hold the value, but they hold alot of static information that is given before instantiation.  Can we dup? Can we split it up and have the value seperate?
