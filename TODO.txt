midwife starts up and gathers kickstart templates, package groups, scripts, and partition defs

then it begins reading the hosts.

A host gathers:
  * partitioning information
  * networking information
    - needs access to domain info


host "n001" do
  template   :default
  partitions  :default
  interface 'eth0' do
    domain    'fortytwo.ibest.uidaho.edu'
    bootproto :static
    ipaddr    '192.168.142.10'
    mac       '00:11:22:33:44:55'
  end
end


the big question is do I want to preload everything.  If so i 
have a host class that loads the packages, scripts, partitions
and interfaces
